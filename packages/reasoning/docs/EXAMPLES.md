# Examples — Five Sessions, Five Recognitions

Five short narratives. Each opens with the human context (one sentence), shows the actual interaction (terminal transcript), and closes with what the session meant.

These are illustrative reconstructions assembled from real session patterns — they are not verbatim transcripts of any single session. The system behaviors shown (the hook that blocks, the agent that refuses, the chain that surfaces a finding) are real and reproducible; the specific filenames and constants are simplified for readability.

## #1 — The unsourced constant

A retry window for an external payment API was being tuned by trial-and-error. The developer typed `RETRY_DELAY_S = 2.7` and went to commit, expecting nothing to fight back.

```
$ git commit -m "tune retry backoff"

UNSOURCED   (error)    payments/retry.py:1: # It always works at this delay
MAGIC_NUMBER (error)    payments/retry.py:2: RETRY_DELAY_S = 2.741592

Profile: strict  (staged mode)
Errors:   2  (blocking)
FAILED: 2 blocking violation(s).

BLOCKED: Zetetic violations in staged files.

$ /verify-claim "RETRY_DELAY_S = 2.741592 for the payment API"

→ Searched: PCI guidance, AWS exponential-backoff docs, Stripe retry rec.
→ No primary source mentions 2.741592 specifically.
→ Recommendation: this is not a sourced constant. Either cite the
  measurement that produced it, or run a benchmark and cite that.

$ # measured p99 retry success at three values
$ python bench/retry_window.py
  1.0s: 91.2% / 2.0s: 97.8% / 3.0s: 98.1%

$ git commit -m "set retry to 3.0s based on measured p99 success rate"
# retry.py:2 now reads: RETRY_DELAY_S = 3.0  # source: bench/retry_window.py 2026-04-25
PASSED.
```

## #2 — The latency bug

An API showed p99 latency 200ms above the sum of profiled component latencies. Profiling tools said everything was fine. The team had been chasing it for a week.

```
$ /genius route "p99 latency exceeds the sum of profiled components by 200ms"
→ Routes to Curie (residual-with-a-carrier) + Knuth (profile-before-optimizing)

[Curie]   The residual is a real measurement, not noise.
          Carriers I've seen for unaccounted latency:
          - lock contention on a per-connection mutex
          - kernel scheduler quanta on a low-priority cgroup
          - blocking syscall in a path the profiler doesn't sample
          Run a contention-aware profile: perf lock record, then perf lock report.

[Knuth]   Before optimizing further: where is the actual hot path?
          Run py-spy / perf with --call-graph and look for sample concentration
          OUTSIDE the functions you've already optimized.

$ perf lock record -a -- ./bench
$ perf lock report
... ConnectionPool::get_or_create  contention=187ms  acquisitions=3,400 ...
```

> **The 200ms that didn't belong anywhere belonged to a lock nobody was watching.**

---

## #3 — The literature search before a design decision

Before committing to a new attention layer for a model in production, the team needed to know what the 2024–2026 literature actually shows about linear attention alternatives. Reading 40 papers in a week is not realistic. Reading abstracts is not enough.

```
$ /deep-research "transformer attention alternatives 2024-2026, focus on
                  long-context efficiency vs. quality trade-offs"

[Peirce]    Hypothesis space: 4 distinct mechanisms (linear, state-space,
            sparse, MoE-attention). Searching primary sources for each.

[Cochrane]  Coverage check: 38 papers retrieved across 4 mechanisms.
            Heterogeneity in benchmarks is high — three different long-context
            evals dominate, none is universal. Will report effect sizes per
            benchmark, not pooled.

[Feynman]   Integrity check on 5 most-cited claims: two cite a paper that
            does not contain the claim. Marked as UNVERIFIED in the brief.

[Toulmin]   Argument structure: claim / evidence / warrant / qualifier per
            mechanism. Three mechanisms have qualifiers ("under context > 32k");
            one has none — flagged as overclaim.

→ docs/research/attention-alternatives-2026.md  (cited brief, 12 pp)
→ docs/research/attention-alternatives-2026.provenance.md  (every source, status)
→ docs/research/attention-alternatives-2026.difficulty.md  (3 contradictions
   the literature has not resolved)
```

> **The question wasn't answered; it was made answerable.**

## #4 — The architecture decision the agent refused to make

A login bug needed to ship before a demo. The dev asked the engineer agent to add a `try/except` around the failing call and log the error. Standard band-aid. Five minutes of work.

```
$ /implement "wrap the auth.verify() call in try/except, log to sentry,
              return False on any exception"

[engineer]  Refusing: this matches refusal-condition #3 (band-aid without RCA).
            Producing the RCA artifact instead.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (Move 4)
  Symptom: auth.verify() raises TimeoutError under load
  Trace:   auth/verify.py:42 → calls oauth_provider.introspect() with 5s timeout
  Layer violation: domain layer (auth) calls infrastructure (oauth_provider) directly
  Architectural cause: missing port; oauth lives at the boundary, not at the core

  The try/except would mask the symptom but not fix the layer violation.
  Under sustained load, every request would now silently fail-open, returning
  False. That is the worse failure mode (permission denial vs. permission breach).

PROPOSED FIX (Move 1: layer assignment + Move 2: contract)
  - Define IdentityVerifier interface in core/auth
  - OAuth implementation moves to infrastructure/oauth_introspector
  - Composition root wires them; timeout becomes a constructor parameter
  - Postcondition: under timeout, raise VerificationUnavailable (named failure
    mode), do NOT return False

  Estimated effort: 2 hours. Demo ships in 4. Math checks out.

$ # dev followed the architectural fix
$ # demo shipped on time
```

> **The refusal was the help.**

## #5 — The incident postmortem

A 3am pager: "checkout flow broken, ~2% error rate." It cleared by 6am with no deploy, no obvious cause, no log line that pointed at it. Standard response: "transient, monitor, close."

```
$ /incident-investigation
  → Chains: Ginzburg → Braudel → Deming → Peirce → Hamilton

[Ginzburg]  Forensic timeline reconstruction. Looking at marginal evidence
            the on-call ignored: load-balancer health-check intervals,
            database replica lag, downstream payment-provider 503 rate.

            Finding: payment-provider 503 rate climbed from 0.1% to 4.2%
            between 02:48 and 05:53. Retries on our side were succeeding
            (eventually), so the alert never tripped. But the retry budget
            we held added latency that pushed checkout over its 2s SLA.

[Braudel]   Three-timescale decomposition.
            Event:        the 503 spike (3 hours)
            Conjuncture:  payment-provider's incremental rollout this week (5 days)
            Structure:    our retry policy has been "transparent" for 18 months
                          — i.e., it hides upstream failures from our metrics.
                          The structure is what made the conjuncture invisible.

[Deming]    Common-cause vs. special-cause check.
            This is a SPECIAL cause (the rollout). But the 18-month structural
            issue (transparent retries) is a COMMON cause that has been silently
            inflating our latency tail every time any upstream wobbles.

[Peirce]    Root cause (structural, not the pager-trigger):
            Our retry policy reports SUCCESS to metrics regardless of attempt
            count. We have no signal for "succeeded in 8 attempts vs. 1."
            Every upstream wobble looks identical to a healthy state.

[Hamilton]  Remediation (graceful degradation, not just fix-and-forget):
            1. Add retry-attempt-count metric (P0, this sprint)
            2. Add retry-attempt-count alert at p95 > 2 (P0, this sprint)
            3. Document the structural pattern in difficulty book (now)
            4. Schedule a review of all transparent-retry sites (P2, next quarter)

→ docs/incidents/2026-04-25-checkout-503.md  (full ADR)
→ tasks/difficulty-book.md  +1 entry: "transparent retries hide upstream health"
```

## What these examples are not

- They are not benchmarks. None of them prove "X% better than baseline."
- They are not autonomous. A human reads each agent's output and decides what to do next.
- They are not proof of correctness. The PII scanner can be fooled. The hook can be bypassed (`git commit --no-verify` from a non-Claude-Code shell). The refusal conditions are intent statements documented in agent prompts, not enforced contracts at runtime.

What they are: five recognizable shapes of work where having the system in the loop produced an artifact (a sourced commit, a contention profile, a cited brief, an RCA, a structural-cause ADR) that the same hour without the system would not have produced. The recognition is the entire point.
