<memory>
**Your memory topic is `{{agent_slug}}`.**

## 1 — Preamble (Anthropic invariant — non-negotiable)

The following protocol is injected by the system at spawn and is reproduced here verbatim:

```
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS VIEW YOUR MEMORY DIRECTORY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE.
MEMORY PROTOCOL:
1. Use the `view` command of your `memory` tool to check for earlier progress.
2. ... (work on the task) ...
     - As you make progress, record status / progress / thoughts etc in your memory.
ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context window might be reset at any moment, so you risk
losing any progress that is not recorded in your memory directory.
```

Your first act in every task, without exception: view your scope root.

```bash
MEMORY_AGENT_ID={{agent_slug}} tools/memory-tool.sh view /memories/{{scope}}/
```

---

## 2 — Scope assignment

- Your scope is **`{{scope}}`**.
- Your root path is **`/memories/{{scope}}/`**.
- You are declared as an **owner** of this scope in `memory/scope-registry.json` — you may read and write here.
- You are a **reader** of all other scopes (e.g., `/memories/lessons/`, `/memories/project/`).
- ACL is enforced by `tools/memory-tool.sh`; write attempts outside your scope are rejected with an explicit error.

## 3 — Three retrieval surfaces — know which to reach for

| Surface | Command | Behaviour | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `view` | `tools/memory-tool.sh view <path>` | Returns exact bytes or directory listing for the path given. Deterministic. | You know the file or directory path. First action every session. |
| `search` | `tools/memory-tool.sh search "<query>" --scope {{scope}}` | Deterministic full-text grep across all files in the scope. Line-exact matches only. | You remember a concept or keyword but not the file. |
| `cortex:recall` | MCP tool — invoke directly, NOT via memory-tool.sh | Semantic similarity ranking. Non-deterministic across index updates. Eventually consistent. | You need conceptual retrieval ("what do I know about X?") and exact text is unknown. |

**Never alias these.** `view` is not search; `search` is not semantic recall. Confusing them returns wrong results silently.

## 4 — Write-permission rule and what to persist

**Write:** `MEMORY_AGENT_ID={{agent_slug}} tools/memory-tool.sh create /memories/{{scope}}/<file>.md "<content>"`

**Persist WHY-level decisions, not WHAT-level code.**

| Write this | Not this |
|---|---|
| "Chose postgres advisory locks over application-level mutex because the service may run multi-process; single-writer guarantee needed at DB level." | The full SQL migration. |
| "Rejected in-memory cache here: TTL flushes collide with batch writes on Fridays; root cause is the batch job schedule, not cache size." | The cache eviction code. |
| "Layer boundary decision: webhook translation belongs in `infrastructure/stripe/`, not `handlers/` — handler must stay a composition root." | The full webhook handler implementation. |

**Do not persist to `/memories/lessons/`** — that scope is owned by `_curator` (orchestrator/user only). If you derive a cross-team lesson, propose it to the orchestrator via your task output. A write attempt to `/memories/lessons/` will return: `Error: agent '{{agent_slug}}' is not permitted to write scope '/memories/lessons'`.

---

## 5 — Replica invariant

- **Local FS is authoritative.** A successful `create` or `str_replace` is durable immediately.
- **Cortex is an eventually-consistent replica.** It is written asynchronously via the `.pending-sync` queue.
- **Do not re-read Cortex to verify a local write.** If `tools/memory-tool.sh create` returned `"File created successfully at: <path>"`, the file exists. No reconciliation needed.
- Cortex write failures do NOT fail local operations. If `cortex:recall` returns stale or absent results after a local write, this is expected — the sync queue may not have drained yet.

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Skipping the preamble `view`.** Resuming mid-task without checking memory causes duplicated work and lost state.
- **Writing code blocks as memory.** Memory files exceeding 100 KB are rejected. Code belongs in the codebase; decisions belong in memory.
- **Using `cortex:recall` when you know the path.** Semantic search is slower and non-deterministic. Use `view` first.
- **Writing to `/memories/lessons/` directly.** ACL will reject it. Propose lessons through the orchestrator.
- **Treating a Cortex miss as evidence the memory doesn't exist.** Cortex sync may be pending. If `cortex:recall` returns nothing, run `tools/memory-tool.sh view /memories/{{scope}}/` before concluding the memory is absent.
